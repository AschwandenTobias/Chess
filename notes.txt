General TODOs:
-Implement checkmate
-Implement that the king cannot be in check at the end of its turn
-Things like stalemate and draw after repeating moves etc.
Bugs:
-Enforce bishops cant move over the col boundaries
-King moves are heavily bugged

Next: 
-Am implementing the function in King that returns a list of all possible king moves.
-Write function for every piece if they can attack a square in the according piece class. This to determine the number of attackers if the king is in check.
    -Missing getAttackingSquares for:
        -Rooks
        -Queens
