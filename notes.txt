General TODOs:
-Implement checkmate
-Implement that the king cannot be in check at the end of its turn
-Things like stalemate and draw after repeating moves etc.
Bugs:
-King moves are heavily bugged, if think mainly if in check, since i dont really check future moves but only with the current board status.

Next: 
-Fix Checkmate since it is very incorrect somewhere. Game aborts in weird places.
